A terrible Chess game and, eventually, a chess bot. Should be approximately better than Suckerpinch's wonderful Worstfish algorithm, although likely not better than its namesake.

Built with the wonderful LibGDX libary for Java gamemaking, because it's useful, if basic, and I am nothing if not terrible to myself in making everything harder than it needs to be.

I waded into this minefield of deciding to program Chess because I have been informed that I have outgrown my beloved Tic-Tac-Toe games (although Project Morris v3.0 for MATLAB may or may not be coming to a GitHub near you soon), and because I made a (terrrible) Checkers game for my AP Comp Sci Principles exam final in Code.org's JS, so this seemed like the logical next step (plus, it's a good reason for me to work on something long form and keep in touch with my chess playing friends with correspondence games on this terrible platform I am building)

Wish me luck on this voyage on the rapidly sinking vessel that is my ability to actually be intelligent with my Java coding, I promise not to explode (too much).

As Georg Fabricus once said, "Death comes to all, but great achievements build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold." This quote isn't particularly related, other than in that I hope that this chess game doesn't count as one of my great achievements, because if so jeez have I failed later in life.

Toodles!
